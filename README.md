# Hey, I'm Chad ðŸ‘‹

I'm a builder, not just a coder.

- ðŸ§© I make tools â€” digital and physical â€” through [CyberFlux Labs](https://cyberflux-labs.com)
- ðŸ§  I build apps like [Quilt Calculator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chadsprojects.quiltingcalculator) and [Survive The Day](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=5458445399587789319)
- ðŸ›’ I run multiple Etsy shops and a Shopify storefront at [CR3DesignCo.com](https://cr3designco.com)
- ðŸ”§ Iâ€™ve transitioned from 20+ years in logistics to full-time creative work

> Most of whatâ€™s here supports real projects â€” not tutorials. I ship things that solve problems.
